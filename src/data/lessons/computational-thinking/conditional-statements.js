    <h2>What are Conditional Statements? üö¶</h2>
    <p><strong>Conditional statements</strong> are like traffic lights for your code - they help your program decide which path to take based on different situations! Just like you make decisions every day ("If it's raining, I'll take an umbrella"), programs use conditional statements to make smart choices automatically.</p>
    
    <p>Think of conditional statements as the "brain" of your program that allows it to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>üéØ <strong>Make Decisions:</strong> Choose different actions based on conditions</li>
      <li>üîÄ <strong>Control Flow:</strong> Direct your program down different paths</li>
      <li>üõ°Ô∏è <strong>Handle Errors:</strong> Check for problems and respond appropriately</li>
      <li>üéÆ <strong>Create Interactivity:</strong> Respond to user input and choices</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The Basic If Statement üìù</h2>
    <p>The <code>if</code> statement is the foundation of conditional logic. It says: "If this condition is true, then do this action."</p>
    
    <h3>JavaScript If Statement Example</h3>
    <pre><code>let temperature = 25;

if (temperature > 20) {
    console.log("It's a warm day! Perfect for outdoor activities.");
}</code></pre>
    
    <h3>Python If Statement Example üêç</h3>
    <pre><code># Python uses indentation instead of curly braces
temperature = 25

if temperature > 20:
    print("It's a warm day! Perfect for outdoor activities!")</code></pre>

    <h2>If-Else Statements ‚öñÔ∏è</h2>
    <p>Sometimes you want to do one thing if a condition is true, and something different if it's false. That's where <code>else</code> comes in!</p>
    
    <h3>JavaScript If-Else Example</h3>
    <pre><code>let age = 16;

if (age >= 18) {
    console.log("You can vote!");
} else {
    console.log("You're not old enough to vote yet.");
}</code></pre>
    
    <h3>Python If-Else Example üêç</h3>
    <pre><code>age = 16

if age >= 18:
    print("You can vote!")
else:
    print("You're not old enough to vote yet.")</code></pre>

    <h2>Multiple Conditions with Else If üé≠</h2>
    <p>When you have more than two possibilities, you can chain conditions together using <code>else if</code> (or <code>elif</code> in Python).</p>
    
    <pre><code>let score = 85;

if (score >= 90) {
    console.log("Excellent! You got an A!");
} else if (score >= 80) {
    console.log("Great job! You got a B!");
} else if (score >= 70) {
    console.log("Good work! You got a C!");
} else if (score >= 60) {
    console.log("You passed with a D.");
} else {
    console.log("You need to study more. Try again!");
}</code></pre>

    <h2>Logical Operators üß†</h2>
    <p>Logical operators help you combine multiple conditions to make more complex decisions:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li><code>&&</code> (AND): Both conditions must be true</li>
      <li><code>||</code> (OR): At least one condition must be true</li>
      <li><code>!</code> (NOT): Reverses the condition</li>
    </ul>
    
    <pre><code>let age = 16;
let hasPermission = true;

// AND operator - both conditions must be true
if (age >= 16 && hasPermission) {
    console.log("You can drive!");
}

// OR operator - at least one condition must be true
if (age >= 18 || hasPermission) {
    console.log("You have some driving privileges!");
}

// NOT operator - reverses the condition
if (!hasPermission) {
    console.log("You need permission first!");
}</code></pre>

    <h2>Switch Statements üéõÔ∏è</h2>
    <p>When you have many possible values to check against, a <code>switch</code> statement can be cleaner than multiple <code>if-else</code> statements.</p>
    
    <pre><code>let day = "Monday";
let activity;

switch (day) {
    case "Monday":
        activity = "Math class";
        break;
    case "Tuesday":
        activity = "Science lab";
        break;
    case "Wednesday":
        activity = "Art project";
        break;
    case "Thursday":
        activity = "PE class";
        break;
    case "Friday":
        activity = "Quiz day";
        break;
    case "Saturday":
    case "Sunday":
        activity = "Weekend fun!";
        break;
    default:
        activity = "Unknown day";
}

console.log(\`Today's activity: \$\{activity\}\`);
</code></pre>
    
    <h3>Python Alternative (Dictionary Approach) üêç</h3>
    <pre><code># Python doesn't have switch, but dictionaries work great!
day = "Monday"

activities = {
    "Monday": "Math class",
    "Tuesday": "Science lab",
    "Wednesday": "Art project",
    "Thursday": "PE class",
    "Friday": "Quiz day",
    "Saturday": "Weekend fun!",
    "Sunday": "Weekend fun!"
}

activity = activities.get(day, "Unknown day")
print(f"Today's activity: {activity}")</code></pre>

    <h2>Common Patterns and Best Practices üé®</h2>
    
    <h3>Input Validation üõ°Ô∏è</h3>
    <pre><code>function validateAge(age) {
    if (age < 0) {
        return "Age cannot be negative!";
    } else if (age > 150) {
        return "That seems too old to be realistic!";
    } else {
        return "Valid age!";
    }
}</code></pre>
    
    <h3>Nested Conditions ü™Ü</h3>
    <pre><code>let weather = "sunny";
let temperature = 25;

if (weather === "sunny") {
    if (temperature > 20) {
        console.log("Perfect day for a picnic!");
    } else {
        console.log("Sunny but a bit chilly.");
    }
} else if (weather === "rainy") {
    console.log("Better stay inside today.");
}</code></pre>
    
    <h3>Best Practices Tips üí°</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Keep It Simple:</strong> Don't nest conditions too deeply</li>
      <li><strong>Use Clear Comparisons:</strong> Be explicit about what you're checking</li>
      <li><strong>Consider Alternatives:</strong> Sometimes functions or lookup tables are clearer</li>
      <li><strong>Test Thoroughly:</strong> Check all possible paths through your conditions</li>
      <li><strong>Use Meaningful Names:</strong> Make your conditions self-documenting</li>
      <li><strong>Avoid Redundant Checks:</strong> Don't test the same condition multiple times</li>
      <li><strong>Consider Lookup Tables:</strong> For many conditions, dictionaries might be faster</li>
    </ul>
