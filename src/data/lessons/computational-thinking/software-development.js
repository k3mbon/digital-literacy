    <h2>What is Software Development? 🚀</h2>
    <p><strong>Software development</strong> is like being a digital architect and builder! It's the process of creating computer programs, apps, games, and websites that people use every day. Just like building a house, you need to plan, design, and build your software step by step!</p>
    
    <p>Software development is everywhere around us:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>📱 <strong>Mobile Apps:</strong> Games, social media, learning apps on your phone</li>
      <li>🎮 <strong>Video Games:</strong> From simple puzzle games to complex adventures</li>
      <li>🌐 <strong>Websites:</strong> Online stores, search engines, video platforms</li>
      <li>💻 <strong>Computer Programs:</strong> Word processors, photo editors, music players</li>
      <li>🏠 <strong>Smart Home Devices:</strong> Voice assistants, smart lights, security systems</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>The Software Development Journey! 🗺️</h2>
    
    <h3>1. Planning Phase - The Big Idea! 💡</h3>
    <p>Every great app starts with an idea! This is where we figure out:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>What problem are we solving?</strong> (Like helping students learn math)</li>
      <li><strong>Who will use our software?</strong> (Students, teachers, parents)</li>
      <li><strong>What features do we need?</strong> (Practice problems, progress tracking, rewards)</li>
      <li><strong>How will it look and feel?</strong> (Colorful, fun, easy to use)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>2. Design Phase - Drawing the Blueprint! 📐</h3>
    <p>Just like architects draw blueprints before building a house, we design our software:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>User Interface (UI) Design:</strong> How the app will look (colors, buttons, layout)</li>
      <li><strong>User Experience (UX) Design:</strong> How easy and fun it is to use</li>
      <li><strong>System Design:</strong> How different parts of the program work together</li>
      <li><strong>Database Design:</strong> How we store and organize information</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>3. Coding Phase - Building the Magic! ⚡</h3>
    <p>This is where we write the actual code that makes our software work:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Frontend Development:</strong> The part users see and interact with</li>
      <li><strong>Backend Development:</strong> The behind-the-scenes logic and data processing</li>
      <li><strong>Database Development:</strong> Storing and managing information</li>
      <li><strong>API Development:</strong> Connecting different parts of the software</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>4. Testing Phase - Making Sure Everything Works! 🧪</h3>
    <p>We test our software to find and fix problems:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Unit Testing:</strong> Testing individual pieces of code</li>
      <li><strong>Integration Testing:</strong> Making sure different parts work together</li>
      <li><strong>User Testing:</strong> Having real people try the software</li>
      <li><strong>Bug Fixing:</strong> Solving problems and improving performance</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>5. Deployment Phase - Sharing with the World! 🌍</h3>
    <p>Finally, we make our software available for people to use:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>App Stores:</strong> Publishing mobile apps</li>
      <li><strong>Web Hosting:</strong> Making websites available online</li>
      <li><strong>Software Distribution:</strong> Getting desktop programs to users</li>
