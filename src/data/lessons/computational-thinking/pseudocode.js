    <h2>What is Pseudocode?</h2>
    <p><strong>Pseudocode</strong> is a high-level description of a computer program's logic that uses natural language mixed with programming concepts. It serves as a bridge between human thinking and actual code implementation, making it easier to plan and communicate algorithms before writing them in a specific programming language.</p>
    
    <h3>Key Characteristics of Pseudocode:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Language Independent:</strong> Not tied to any specific programming language</li>
      <li><strong>Easy to Read:</strong> Uses natural language constructs</li>
      <li><strong>Structured:</strong> Follows logical programming structures</li>
      <li><strong>Detailed:</strong> More detailed than flowcharts but less detailed than actual code</li>
      <li><strong>Flexible:</strong> No strict syntax rules to follow</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Benefits of Using Pseudocode</h2>
    
    <h3>1. Planning and Design</h3>
    <p>Pseudocode helps programmers think through the logic of their programs before diving into actual coding. This planning phase can save significant time and reduce errors in the final implementation.</p>
    
    <h3>2. Communication</h3>
    <p>It serves as an excellent communication tool between team members, allowing developers to discuss algorithms and logic without getting bogged down in syntax details.</p>
    
    <h3>3. Documentation</h3>
    <p>Pseudocode can serve as documentation for complex algorithms, making it easier for others (or yourself in the future) to understand the program's logic.</p>
    
    <h3>4. Language Translation</h3>
    <p>Once you have pseudocode, it's easier to translate it into any programming language, making your algorithms more portable.</p>
    
    <h2>Common Pseudocode Conventions</h2>
    
    <h3>1. Control Structures</h3>
    
    <h4>Sequential Operations:</h4>
    <pre><code>BEGIN
    READ user_input
    calculate result = user_input * 2
    display result
END</code></pre>
    
    <h4>Conditional Statements:</h4>
    <pre><code>IF condition THEN
    statement1
ELSE
    statement2
ENDIF

// Example:
IF age >= 18 THEN
    display "You can vote"
ELSE
    display "You cannot vote yet"
ENDIF</code></pre>
    
    <h4>Loops:</h4>
    <pre><code>// For Loop
FOR counter = 1 TO 10
    display counter
ENDFOR

// While Loop
WHILE condition IS TRUE
    statement
ENDWHILE

// Example
WHILE password IS NOT CORRECT
    read password
    IF attempts > 3 THEN
        display "Account locked"
        exit
    ENDIF
ENDWHILE</code></pre>
    
    <h3>2. Data Operations</h3>
    
    <h4>Variable Assignment:</h4>
    <pre><code>SET variable_name = value
SET total = 0
SET name = "John Doe"
SET is_valid = TRUE</code></pre>
    
    <h4>Input and Output:</h4>
    <pre><code>READ variable_name
DISPLAY message
PRINT result

// Examples
READ user_age
DISPLAY "Welcome to our program"
PRINT "Your age is: " + user_age</code></pre>
    
    <h2>Real-World Examples</h2>
    
    <h3>Example 1: Simple Calculator</h3>
    <pre><code>BEGIN Calculator
    DISPLAY "Simple Calculator"
    READ first_number
    read operation (+, -, *, /)
    read second_number
    
    IF operation = "+" THEN
        result = first_number + second_number
    ELSE IF operation = "-" THEN
        result = first_number - second_number
    ELSE IF operation = "*" THEN
        result = first_number * second_number
    ELSE IF operation = "/" THEN
        IF second_number â‰  0 THEN
            result = first_number / second_number
        ELSE
            display "Error: Division by zero"
            exit
        ENDIF
    ELSE
        display "Error: Invalid operation"
        exit
    ENDIF
    
    display "Result: " + result
END</code></pre>
    
    <h3>Example 2: Grade Classification</h3>
    <pre><code>BEGIN Grade_Classifier
    read student_score
    
    IF student_score >= 90 THEN
        grade = "A"
    ELSE IF student_score >= 80 THEN
        grade = "B"
    ELSE IF student_score >= 70 THEN
        grade = "C"
    ELSE IF student_score >= 60 THEN
        grade = "D"
    ELSE
        grade = "F"
    ENDIF
    
    display "Your grade is: " + grade
END</code></pre>

      title: "The History of Pseudocode",
      content: `
        <p>Pseudocode has been used since the early days of computing as a way to plan and communicate algorithms. The concept emerged in the 1950s and 1960s as programmers needed a way to design programs before implementing them in machine-specific languages.</p>
        
        <p>Early computer scientists like John von Neumann and others recognized the need for a human-readable way to express computational logic. This led to the development of various pseudocode conventions that are still used today.</p>
        
        <p>Modern pseudocode has evolved to include structured programming concepts and is now an essential tool in computer science education and professional software development.</p>

      title: "Pseudocode vs. Flowcharts",
      content: `
        <p>While both pseudocode and flowcharts are used to plan algorithms, they have different strengths:</p>
        
        <h4>Pseudocode Advantages:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Faster to write and modify</li>
          <li>More detailed than flowcharts</li>
          <li>Easier to convert to actual code</li>
          <li>Better for complex logic</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Flowchart Advantages:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Visual representation of logic flow</li>
          <li>Easier to understand for non-programmers</li>
          <li>Good for showing decision points</li>
          <li>Helpful for debugging logic errors</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Many programmers use both tools together, starting with flowcharts for overall design and then writing detailed pseudocode for implementation.</p>
