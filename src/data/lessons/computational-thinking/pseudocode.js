    <h2>What are Computer Instructions? ü§ñ</h2>
    <p><strong>Computer instructions</strong> are like writing a recipe for your favorite cookies! Just like a recipe tells you step-by-step how to make cookies, computer instructions tell the computer step-by-step what to do. We call these special instructions "pseudocode" - it's like writing in a language that both people and computers can understand!</p>
    
    <h3>Why Computer Instructions are Super Cool! ‚ú®</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Easy to Understand:</strong> Anyone can read them, just like reading a story!</li>
      <li><strong>Simple Words:</strong> We use everyday words that make sense</li>
      <li><strong>Well Organized:</strong> Everything is in the right order, like steps in a recipe</li>
      <li><strong>Just Right:</strong> Not too simple, not too complicated - just perfect!</li>
      <li><strong>No Strict Rules:</strong> We can be creative with how we write them</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Why Writing Instructions is Awesome! üåü</h2>
    
    <h3>1. Planning Your Ideas üéØ</h3>
    <p>Writing instructions helps us think about what we want to do before we start. It's like making a plan for building the coolest LEGO castle - we think about it first, then build it!</p>
    
    <h3>2. Sharing with Friends üë´</h3>
    <p>When we write clear instructions, we can share our ideas with friends and family. They can understand exactly what we're thinking!</p>
    
    <h3>3. Remembering Later üß†</h3>
    <p>Instructions help us remember how we solved a problem. It's like keeping a diary of all our smart ideas!</p>
    
    <h3>4. Using Anywhere üåç</h3>
    <p>Once we write good instructions, we can use them to solve similar problems anywhere - at home, at school, or even in games!</p>
    
    <h2>How to Write Fun Instructions! üìù</h2>
    
    <h3>1. Step-by-Step Instructions üë£</h3>
    
    <h4>Simple Steps (One After Another):</h4>
    <pre><code>START
    ASK "What's your favorite number?"
    GET the number from you
    MULTIPLY the number by 2
    SHOW the answer
FINISH</code></pre>
    
    <h4>Making Choices (If This, Then That):</h4>
    <pre><code>IF it's sunny outside THEN
    go to the playground
OTHERWISE
    play inside
END IF

// Fun Example:
IF you have 10 or more stickers THEN
    SHOW "Wow! You're a sticker collector!"
OTHERWISE
    SHOW "Keep collecting more stickers!"
END IF</code></pre>
    
    <h4>Doing Things Over and Over (Loops):</h4>
    <pre><code>// Counting Loop
COUNT from 1 to 10
    SAY the number out loud
END COUNT

// Keep Going Loop
WHILE you haven't found your toy
    look in another room
END WHILE

// Fun Example:
WHILE the password is wrong
    ASK "What's the secret word?"
    IF you tried 3 times THEN
        SAY "Too many tries! Ask a grown-up for help"
        STOP
    END IF
END WHILE</code></pre>
    
    <h3>2. Storing and Using Information üì¶</h3>
    
    <h4>Remembering Things (Like Writing on a Sticky Note):</h4>
    <pre><code>REMEMBER my_favorite_color = "blue"
REMEMBER how_many_pets = 2
REMEMBER my_name = "Alex"
REMEMBER is_sunny = YES</code></pre>
    
    <h4>Getting Information and Showing Results:</h4>
    <pre><code>ASK "What's your name?"
GET the_name
SHOW "Hello there!"
TELL "Your name is: " + the_name

// Fun Examples:
ASK "How old are you?"
GET your_age
SHOW "Welcome to our fun game!"
TELL "You are " + your_age + " years old!"</code></pre>
    
    <h2>Cool Examples You Can Try! üéÆ</h2>
    
    <h3>Example 1: Magic Math Helper üßÆ</h3>
    <pre><code>START Magic_Math_Helper
    SHOW "Welcome to the Magic Math Helper!"
    ASK "Give me your first number:"
    GET first_number
    ASK "What do you want to do? (+, -, *, /)"
    GET math_operation
    ASK "Give me your second number:"
    GET second_number
    
    IF math_operation = "+" THEN
        answer = first_number + second_number
    OTHERWISE IF math_operation = "-" THEN
        answer = first_number - second_number
    OTHERWISE IF math_operation = "*" THEN
        answer = first_number * second_number
    OTHERWISE IF math_operation = "/" THEN
        IF second_number is not 0 THEN
            answer = first_number / second_number
        OTHERWISE
            SHOW "Oops! We can't divide by zero!"
            STOP
        END IF
    OTHERWISE
        SHOW "Hmm, I don't know that operation!"
        STOP
    END IF
    
    SHOW "The magic answer is: " + answer
FINISH</code></pre>
    
    <h3>Example 2: Super Star Report Card üåü</h3>
    <pre><code>START Super_Star_Report
    ASK "What's your test score?"
    GET your_score
    
    IF your_score >= 90 THEN
        star_level = "Super Star! ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê"
    OTHERWISE IF your_score >= 80 THEN
        star_level = "Great Job! ‚≠ê‚≠ê"
    OTHERWISE IF your_score >= 70 THEN
        star_level = "Good Work! ‚≠ê"
    OTHERWISE IF your_score >= 60 THEN
        star_level = "Keep Trying! üí™"
    OTHERWISE
        star_level = "Practice More! üìö"
    END IF
    
    SHOW "Your result: " + star_level
FINISH</code></pre>

      title: "The History of Pseudocode",
      content: `
        <p>Pseudocode has been used since the early days of computing as a way to plan and communicate algorithms. The concept emerged in the 1950s and 1960s as programmers needed a way to design programs before implementing them in machine-specific languages.</p>
        
        <p>Early computer scientists like John von Neumann and others recognized the need for a human-readable way to express computational logic. This led to the development of various pseudocode conventions that are still used today.</p>
        
        <p>Modern pseudocode has evolved to include structured programming concepts and is now an essential tool in computer science education and professional software development.</p>

      title: "Pseudocode vs. Flowcharts",
      content: `
        <p>While both pseudocode and flowcharts are used to plan algorithms, they have different strengths:</p>
        
        <h4>Pseudocode Advantages:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Faster to write and modify</li>
          <li>More detailed than flowcharts</li>
          <li>Easier to convert to actual code</li>
          <li>Better for complex logic</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Flowchart Advantages:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Visual representation of logic flow</li>
          <li>Easier to understand for non-programmers</li>
          <li>Good for showing decision points</li>
          <li>Helpful for debugging logic errors</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Many programmers use both tools together, starting with flowcharts for overall design and then writing detailed pseudocode for implementation.</p>
