    <h2>What is Searching?</h2>
    <p><strong>Searching</strong> is the process of finding a specific item or piece of information within a collection of data. It's one of the most fundamental operations in computer science and is used in countless applications, from finding a contact in your phone to searching for information on the internet.</p>
    
    <p>Searching is essential because:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Data retrieval is a core function of most software systems</li>
      <li>Efficient searching saves time and computational resources</li>
      <li>It enables quick access to information in large datasets</li>
      <li>Forms the basis for more complex algorithms</li>
      <li>Critical for database operations and information systems</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Types of Searching</h2>
    
    <h3>1. Linear Search (Sequential Search)</h3>
    <p>Linear search is the simplest searching algorithm that checks each element in a list one by one until the target item is found or the end of the list is reached.</p>
    
    <h4>How Linear Search Works:</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Start at the first element of the list</li>
      <li>Compare the current element with the target value</li>
      <li>If they match, return the position (found!)</li>
      <li>If they don't match, move to the next element</li>
      <li>Repeat until found or end of list is reached</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h4>Linear Search Pseudocode:</h4>
    <pre><code>BEGIN Linear_Search(list, target)
    FOR i = 0 TO length(list) - 1
        IF list[i] = target THEN
            RETURN i  // Found at position i
        ENDIF
    ENDFOR
    RETURN -1  // Not found
END</code></pre>
    
    <h4>Example: Finding a Name in a List</h4>
    <pre><code>BEGIN Find_Student
    SET student_list = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "Diana", "Eve"]
    SET target_name = "Charlie"
    SET position = -1
    
    FOR i = 0 TO 4
        IF student_list[i] = target_name THEN
            SET position = i
            BREAK  // Exit loop when found
        ENDIF
    ENDFOR
    
    IF position â‰  -1 THEN
        DISPLAY target_name + " found at position " + position
    ELSE
        DISPLAY target_name + " not found in the list"
    ENDIF
END</code></pre>
    
    <h3>2. Binary Search</h3>
    <p>Binary search is a much more efficient algorithm that works on sorted lists by repeatedly dividing the search space in half.</p>
    
    <h4>Prerequisites for Binary Search:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Sorted Data:</strong> The list must be arranged in ascending or descending order</li>
      <li><strong>Random Access:</strong> Ability to access any element directly by its index</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>How Binary Search Works:</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Find the middle element of the sorted list</li>
      <li>Compare the middle element with the target value</li>
      <li>If they match, return the position (found!)</li>
      <li>If target is smaller, search the left half</li>
      <li>If target is larger, search the right half</li>
      <li>Repeat until found or search space is empty</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h4>Binary Search Pseudocode:</h4>
    <pre><code>BEGIN Binary_Search(sorted_list, target)
    SET left = 0
    SET right = length(sorted_list) - 1
    
    WHILE left <= right
        SET middle = (left + right) / 2
        
        IF sorted_list[middle] = target THEN
            RETURN middle  // Found at position middle
        ELSE IF sorted_list[middle] < target THEN
            SET left = middle + 1  // Search right half
        ELSE
            SET right = middle - 1  // Search left half
        ENDIF
    ENDWHILE
    
    RETURN -1  // Not found
END</code></pre>
    
    <h4>Example: Finding a Number in a Sorted Array</h4>
    <pre><code>BEGIN Binary_Search_Example
    SET numbers = [2, 5, 8, 12, 16, 23, 38, 45, 67, 78]
    SET target = 23
    SET left = 0
    SET right = 9
    SET found = FALSE
    
    WHILE left <= right AND NOT found
        SET middle = (left + right) / 2
        DISPLAY "Checking position " + middle + ": " + numbers[middle]
        
        IF numbers[middle] = target THEN
            DISPLAY "Found " + target + " at position " + middle
            SET found = TRUE
        ELSE IF numbers[middle] < target THEN
            DISPLAY target + " is larger, searching right half"
            SET left = middle + 1
        ELSE
            DISPLAY target + " is smaller, searching left half"
            SET right = middle - 1
        ENDIF
    ENDWHILE
    
    IF NOT found THEN
        DISPLAY target + " not found in the list"
    ENDIF
END</code></pre>

    <h3>Performance Example</h3>
    <p>For a list of 1,000,000 items:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Linear Search:</strong> May need to check up to 1,000,000 items</li>
      <li><strong>Binary Search:</strong> Will find any item in at most 20 comparisons!</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Advanced Searching Concepts</h2>
    
    <h3>1. Search with Multiple Criteria</h3>
    <pre><code>BEGIN Multi_Criteria_Search
    // Search for students by grade AND age
    FOR each student IN student_database
        IF student.grade = target_grade AND student.age >= min_age THEN
            ADD student TO results
        ENDIF
    ENDFOR
    RETURN results
END</code></pre>
    
    <h3>2. Fuzzy Search (Approximate Matching)</h3>
    <pre><code>BEGIN Fuzzy_Search(list, target, tolerance)
    SET results = []
    FOR each item IN list
        SET similarity = calculate_similarity(item, target)
        IF similarity >= tolerance THEN
            ADD item TO results
        ENDIF
    ENDFOR
    RETURN results
END</code></pre>
    
    <h3>3. Search in 2D Arrays</h3>
    <pre><code>BEGIN Search_2D_Array(matrix, target)
    FOR row = 0 TO number_of_rows - 1
        FOR col = 0 TO number_of_columns - 1
            IF matrix[row][col] = target THEN
                RETURN [row, col]  // Return coordinates
            ENDIF
        ENDFOR
    ENDFOR
    RETURN [-1, -1]  // Not found
END</code></pre>
    
    <h2>Real-World Applications</h2>
    
    <h3>1. Library Management System</h3>
    <pre><code>BEGIN Library_Search
    READ search_type  // "title", "author", "isbn"
    read search_term
    
    IF search_type = "isbn" THEN
        // Use binary search on sorted ISBN list
        result = binary_search(isbn_list, search_term)
    ELSE IF search_type = "title" OR search_type = "author" THEN
        // Use linear search with partial matching
        result = fuzzy_search(book_database, search_term)
    ENDIF
    
    display_search_results(result)
END</code></pre>
    
    <h3>2. E-commerce Product Search</h3>
    <pre><code>BEGIN Product_Search
    read search_query
    read price_range
    read category
    read sort_by  // "price", "rating", "popularity"
    
    SET filtered_products = []
    
    // First filter by category and price
    FOR each product IN product_database
        IF product.category = category AND 
           product.price >= price_range.min AND 
           product.price <= price_range.max THEN
            
            // Check if product matches search query
            IF product.name CONTAINS search_query OR 
               product.description CONTAINS search_query THEN
                ADD product TO filtered_products
            ENDIF
        ENDIF
    ENDFOR
    
    // Sort results
    sort(filtered_products, sort_by)
    
    display_products(filtered_products)
END</code></pre>
    
    <h2>Optimization Techniques</h2>
    
    <h3>1. Early Termination</h3>
    <p>Stop searching as soon as the target is found, especially in linear search.</p>
    
    <h3>2. Indexing</h3>
    <p>Create indexes (like hash tables) for frequently searched fields to speed up lookups.</p>
    
    <h3>3. Caching</h3>
    <p>Store recent search results to avoid repeating expensive searches.</p>
    
    <h3>4. Parallel Search</h3>
    <p>Divide the search space among multiple processors for faster results.</p>

      title: "The History of Search Algorithms",
      content: `
        <p>Search algorithms have evolved alongside computer science itself. Here's a brief timeline of major developments:</p>
        
        <h4>1940s-1950s: Early Computing</h4>
        <p>Linear search was the natural first approach, as early computers had limited memory and simple data structures.</p>
        
        <h4>1960s: Binary Search</h4>
        <p>As computers became more powerful and data sets larger, the need for efficient searching led to the development of binary search. The algorithm was first published by John Mauchly in 1946, but wasn't widely implemented until the 1960s.</p>
        
        <h4>1970s-1980s: Advanced Data Structures</h4>
        <p>The development of hash tables, B-trees, and other advanced data structures revolutionized searching, enabling near-constant time lookups.</p>
        
        <h4>1990s-2000s: Internet Search</h4>
        <p>The explosion of the internet created new challenges in searching vast amounts of unstructured data, leading to innovations like Google's PageRank algorithm.</p>
        
        <h4>2010s-Present: Machine Learning</h4>
        <p>Modern search incorporates machine learning to understand user intent, provide relevant results, and even predict what users are looking for.</p>
      `
    },
    {
      title: "Search in Different Data Structures",
      content: `
        <p>The efficiency of search operations depends heavily on how data is organized:</p>
        
        <h4>Arrays and Lists</h4>
        <p>Linear search: O(n), Binary search (if sorted): O(log n)</p>
        
        <h4>Hash Tables</h4>
        <p>Average case: O(1), Worst case: O(n). Excellent for exact matches.</p>
        
        <h4>Binary Search Trees</h4>
        <p>Average case: O(log n), Worst case: O(n). Good for range queries.</p>
        
        <h4>B-Trees</h4>
        <p>O(log n) with better performance for disk-based storage. Used in databases.</p>
        
        <h4>Tries</h4>
        <p>O(m) where m is the length of the search key. Excellent for prefix matching.</p>
        
        <p>Understanding these trade-offs helps you choose the right data structure for your specific search requirements.</p>
