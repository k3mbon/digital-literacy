    <h2>Introduction to Performance Analysis</h2>
    <p><strong>Performance Analysis</strong> is the systematic study of how efficiently computer systems execute tasks and utilize resources. It involves measuring, analyzing, and optimizing various aspects of system behavior to achieve better throughput, response time, and resource utilization.</p>
    
    <p>Performance analysis is crucial because it:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Identifies Bottlenecks:</strong> Finds components that limit overall system performance</li>
      <li><strong>Guides Optimization:</strong> Provides data-driven insights for improvement decisions</li>
      <li><strong>Ensures Scalability:</strong> Helps systems handle increasing loads effectively</li>
      <li><strong>Reduces Costs:</strong> Optimizes resource usage and infrastructure requirements</li>
      <li><strong>Improves User Experience:</strong> Ensures responsive and reliable system behavior</li>
      <li><strong>Supports Planning:</strong> Enables capacity planning and architecture decisions</li>
    </ul>

      sampleAnswer: "This indicates an I/O bottleneck, likely in the database storage subsystem. The high I/O wait time with moderate CPU/memory usage confirms this. Recommendations: 1) Optimize database queries and add appropriate indexes, 2) Consider SSD storage for better IOPS, 3) Implement database connection pooling, 4) Add read replicas to distribute load, 5) Implement application-level caching.",
