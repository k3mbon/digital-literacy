    <h2>Introduction to Storage Systems</h2>
    <p><strong>Storage Systems</strong> are responsible for the long-term retention of data in computer systems. They provide persistent storage that survives system shutdowns and power failures, enabling data to be preserved and accessed over time.</p>
    
    <p>Storage systems are fundamental to computing because they:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Data Persistence:</strong> Maintain data across system restarts and power cycles</li>
      <li><strong>Capacity:</strong> Provide large amounts of storage space for applications and data</li>
      <li><strong>Performance:</strong> Enable fast access to frequently used data</li>
      <li><strong>Reliability:</strong> Protect against data loss through redundancy and error correction</li>
      <li><strong>Organization:</strong> Structure data in logical hierarchies and formats</li>
      <li><strong>Sharing:</strong> Allow multiple users and applications to access shared data</li>
    </ul>

  // Assessment questions
  assessments: [
    {
      type: "multiple-choice",
      question: "Which RAID level provides the best fault tolerance while maintaining reasonable storage efficiency?",
      options: ["RAID 0", "RAID 1", "RAID 5", "RAID 6"],
      correct: 3,
      explanation: "RAID 6 provides dual parity, allowing it to survive the failure of any two drives while using only two drives worth of capacity for parity information, making it more fault-tolerant than RAID 5 with reasonable storage efficiency."
    },
    {
      type: "scenario-based",
      question: "A company needs to store 100TB of data with the following requirements: high availability, fast random access, and the ability to survive two simultaneous drive failures. They have a budget that allows for 50% storage overhead. Recommend a storage solution and justify your choice.",
      sampleAnswer: "Recommend RAID 6 with SSDs. RAID 6 can survive two drive failures, SSDs provide fast random access, and the dual parity overhead is approximately 25-33% depending on array size, which fits within the 50% budget. Consider NVMe SSDs for maximum performance.",
      rubric: [
        "Correctly identifies RAID 6 as meeting fault tolerance requirements",
        "Recommends appropriate storage technology (SSDs) for performance",
        "Considers cost constraints and storage overhead",
        "Provides clear justification for recommendations"

    },
    {
      type: "comparison",
      question: "Compare the advantages and disadvantages of file-level versus block-level deduplication for a backup storage system.",
      sampleAnswer: "File-level deduplication is simpler and faster but less effective at finding duplicates. Block-level deduplication finds more duplicates and saves more space but requires more processing power and metadata management. For backup systems, block-level is usually preferred despite higher overhead.",
      rubric: [
        "Explains both deduplication approaches clearly",
        "Identifies trade-offs between simplicity and effectiveness",
        "Considers resource requirements and performance impact",

      question: "Design a storage architecture for a video streaming service that needs to store and serve petabytes of video content to millions of users worldwide. Consider performance, scalability, cost, and geographic distribution.",
      correctAnswer: "Use a tiered approach: hot content on fast SSDs near users (CDN edge), warm content on standard storage in regional data centers, cold content on cheap storage or cloud archive. Implement global load balancing, content replication based on popularity, and automated tiering based on access patterns.",
      explanation: "Video streaming requires balancing performance for popular content with cost-effective storage for the long tail of less popular content, while ensuring global availability."
