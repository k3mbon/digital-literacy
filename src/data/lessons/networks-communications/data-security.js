    <h2>Introduction to Data Security</h2>
    <p><strong>Data security</strong> refers to the practice of protecting digital information from unauthorized access, corruption, or theft throughout its entire lifecycle. In our interconnected world, data security is crucial for protecting personal privacy, business operations, and national security.</p>
    
    <p>The CIA Triad forms the foundation of information security:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Confidentiality:</strong> Ensuring information is accessible only to authorized individuals</li>
      <li><strong>Integrity:</strong> Maintaining the accuracy and completeness of data</li>
      <li><strong>Availability:</strong> Ensuring information and resources are accessible when needed</li>
    </ul>

        <p>Cybersecurity has evolved dramatically as our dependence on digital systems has grown:</p>
        
        <h4>1970s-1980s: Early Computer Security</h4>
        <p>Focus on physical security and access control for mainframe computers. The Morris Worm (1988) was one of the first major internet security incidents.</p>
        
        <h4>1990s: Network Security Emerges</h4>
        <p>As networks became widespread, firewalls and antivirus software became essential. The concept of "defense in depth" was established.</p>
        
        <h4>2000s: Internet Security Challenges</h4>
        <p>E-commerce growth brought new threats like credit card fraud and identity theft. SSL/TLS became standard for secure web communications.</p>
        
        <h4>2010s: Advanced Persistent Threats</h4>
        <p>Sophisticated, state-sponsored attacks emerged. Cloud security and mobile device management became critical concerns.</p>
        
        <h4>2020s: AI and IoT Security</h4>
        <p>Artificial intelligence is both a security tool and a threat vector. The Internet of Things creates billions of new attack surfaces.</p>
        
        <h4>Future Challenges</h4>
        <p>Quantum computing threatens current encryption methods, while AI-powered attacks become more sophisticated. Zero-trust architecture and quantum-resistant cryptography are emerging solutions.</p>

        <p>The relationship between privacy and security is complex and often involves trade-offs:</p>
        
        <h4>Privacy Concerns</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Data Collection:</strong> Organizations collect vast amounts of personal data</li>
          <li><strong>Surveillance:</strong> Government and corporate monitoring capabilities</li>
          <li><strong>Data Sharing:</strong> Information shared between organizations</li>
          <li><strong>Profiling:</strong> Creating detailed profiles of individuals</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Security Needs</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Threat Detection:</strong> Monitoring for malicious activities</li>
          <li><strong>Identity Verification:</strong> Confirming user identities</li>
          <li><strong>Incident Response:</strong> Investigating security breaches</li>
          <li><strong>Compliance:</strong> Meeting regulatory requirements</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Finding Balance</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Privacy by Design:</strong> Building privacy into systems from the start</li>
          <li><strong>Data Minimization:</strong> Collecting only necessary information</li>
          <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> Clear communication about data practices</li>
          <li><strong>User Control:</strong> Giving individuals control over their data</li>
          <li><strong>Strong Governance:</strong> Policies and oversight for data handling</li>

Asymmetric encryption uses key pairs (public/private), solving key distribution but being slower. Used for key exchange, digital signatures, and small data encryption.",
